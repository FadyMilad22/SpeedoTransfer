**Speedo Transfer** is an Android application utilizing Jetpack Compose for online authentication and advanced Android topics. This app is designed to provide **secure and convenient money transfers**, incorporating features similar to online banking and mobile money apps. It also implements a **distributed system** requirement, with the backend accessed via Retrofit.

## Jetpack Compose

This project leverages **Jetpack Compose**, a modern UI toolkit for building native Android applications. Compose allows for creating intuitive, responsive, and dynamic UIs with less code and reduced complexity compared to the traditional XML-based UI approach.

### Key Features of Jetpack Compose:
- **Declarative UI**: Compose follows a declarative programming model, allowing you to describe what the UI should look like for a given state, with automatic handling of rendering and updates.
- **Kotlin Integration**: Built entirely with Kotlin, making it concise, powerful, and highly interoperable with existing Android code.
- **State Management**: Powerful state handling with `State`, `MutableState`, and `remember`, making UI state management easier across components.
- **Composable Functions**: The core building blocks of Compose are `@Composable` functions, which define reusable UI components.

## Architecture

The **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture pattern is used in this project, providing a clear separation of responsibilities and better organization of the codebase. MVVM helps abstract the logic of actions that can be performed in the app and ensures maintainability and testability.
